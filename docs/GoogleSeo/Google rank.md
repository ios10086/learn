# How does Google rank websites

search engines like Google follow three basic steps to rank a website.

## Crawling 

Crawling is process done by search engine spiders/bots where they scan a website and copy the entire website's content and stores it in search engines's index

## Indexing 

in case a website is not in a search engine's index, none of the user will be able to find the websit.

## Ranking 

when a user types a query on Google search engine, the most relevant websites (from the index) will appear on the search result based on multiple factors like user's location, language, user experience etc.
