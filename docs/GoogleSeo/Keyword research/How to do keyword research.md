## Search volume

- For example, phrases like **funny halloween costumes** will have more search volume in October (as halloween day is on 31st October)

## Competition/Difficulty

- Higher the competition, harder it is to rank #1 on Google SERP
- High search volume and low competition keyword is the ideal combination to prefer

*Note: Understand your business and find keywords relevant to your business*

## Commercial intent
